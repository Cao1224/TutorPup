gui is basically done, if a little boring. will go back later to add pics of the pupper and such to home screen at least

added TODO comments for touch sensor and question database implementation

also i think we need to add code for managing pupper idle motions to make it seem more "alive"

and do we want a page for where the user can review the questions currently in the database?
